# image_segmentation
 -- Used Indian Driving Dataset (IDD), which is a collection of autonomous driving annotated street-level images captured on Indian roads for image segmentation tasks.
-- Implemented Canet architecture using TensorFlow and Keras ( achieved IOU score >0.7).
-- Trained Unet model imported from segmentation models library(achieved IOU score >0.7).
--Used dice loss and IOU score as metrics for evaluating the model performance.
